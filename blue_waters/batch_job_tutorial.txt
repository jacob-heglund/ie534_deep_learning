0. This files gives a tutorial on how to run a batch job using a pbs file.  Batch jobs run in the background and cannot be interacted with.  Therefore, make sure your code saves any important data to disk!
- I have included a file called 'test_job.py' that will run with using the "generate_pbs.py" in the repo.
- The code saves an array of numbers to disk, so it is a nice example to try first.  
- Use 'test_job.py' as an exercise to get a job working using the instructions below.

1. Make a copy of "generate_pbs.py" from the project repo and put it in the same directory as the file you want to run (on your computer, we're not on Blue Waters yet!)

2. Modify these fields in "generate_pbs.py":
trainingFilename = 'test_job.py'
walltime = '00:30:00'
jobname ='my_training_job_name'
netid = 'jheglun2'

- note that walltime must be between 00:30:00 and 48:00:00 (30 minute minimum, 48 hour maximum)
- if your code finishes running before your walltime is done, your session ends and your hours won't be wasted

3. SSH into a Blue Waters login node using:
ssh traXXX@bwbay.ncsa.illinois.edu
Password: blah

4. Copy over any files to Blue Waters so "generate_pbs.py" is in the same directory as the file you want to run
- Use WinSCP if you have a cool operating system 
- otherwise, use bash commands (cd, cp, scp, etc.) (see the interactive jobs tutorial)

5. cd to the code directory, and run "generate_pbs.py" using this command:
python generate_pbs.py

6. Begin your job using this command:
qsub run.pbs
- if successful, you will see something like this 
INFO: Job submitted to account: bauh
job_id.bw

7. Your job will now run in the background.  It may take a while for the code to start running.
- If you want to check the status, use this command:
qstat | grep traXXX
- the possible statuses are:
Q - in the queue (waiting to be run)
R - running
C - complete

- the command "#PBS -m bea" is set in the PBS file so that Blue Waters will 
email you at yourNetID@illinois.edu when your job begins and ends
- you can remove this command by modifying "generate_pbs.py", but why would you?

8. If you want to stop your job at any time run this command:
qdel job_id.bw

9. When completed, your code will output:
my_training_job_name_0.9136712.bw.err - for any python errors that occur during code execution
my_training_job_name_0.9136712.bw.out - for the job parameters

- you will also get an email when the code is done running
- the begin email looks like this
BW Job ID: 9136796.bw 
 Job Name: my_training_job_name_0 
 Exec host list suppressed in email 
 Begun execution

- and the end email looks like this:
BW Job ID: 9136796.bw 
 Job Name: my_training_job_name_0 
 Exec host list suppressed in email 
 Execution terminated 
 Exit_status=0
resources_used.cput=00:00:00

resources_used.walltime=00:00:09
